# Introduction

The DBS (Digitaler Bürgerservice / Digital Citizen Service) is a digital service provided by the government of the city of Munich, designed to facilitate access to municipal services for citizens. The platform employs a user-centered approach, allowing citizens to quickly identify relevant services by answering targeted, straightforward questions about their current life situations.

This process generates a personalized checklist of services tailored to the user's inputs, enhancing the user experience through an intuitive interface optimized for mobile devices. The system is built on modern web technologies and follows an Open Source model, enabling other municipalities to leverage the source code and foster interoperability.

It currently consists of these modules:

- [DBS-Ticketing](/architecture#ticketing)
- [DBS-P13N](/architecture#p13n)
- [DBS-Login](/architecture#login)
- Terminvereinbarung (<https://github.com/it-at-m/eappointment>)
